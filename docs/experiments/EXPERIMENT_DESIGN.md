## Standard protocol — fixed across all IR candidates

This is a **search** for an IR representation that supports the hypothesis (that models
trained on semantic structure learn math more efficiently). The unit of work is an
**IR candidate** — a concrete token configuration (e.g. v2.0.0, a v2.1 tweak like
revised GEN buckets, or a v3 redesign). We don't know yet whether the answer is a
refined v2 or a new design; the protocol below keeps every candidate comparable so
the search can proceed without re-baselining.

These elements are **frozen** so that any IR candidate produces results directly
comparable to v2. Do not change them between candidates; if a protocol change is ever
needed, version it separately and re-baseline.

### Eval protocol (fixed)
- **Metric:** top-1 next-token completion accuracy (teacher-forced, last N tokens masked).
- **Sample count:** 200 eval examples.
- **Mask-last:** 10 tokens.
- **Checkpoint selection:** always pass an explicit `--checkpoint-<X> <authoritative run dir>`.
  Never rely on the default `runs/variant_X/` path (stale-checkpoint bug — see
  `docs/scratch/runs_audit.md`, `docs/scratch/variant_c_eval_bug.md`). The
  `eval_completion.py` stale-checkpoint guard warns if `results.json` mtime is >1d off
  from the checkpoint weights.
- **Command template (identical for every variant/IR version):**
  ```bash
  python3 python/eval_completion.py \
    --variants <X> --checkpoint-<X> runs/<authoritative_dir> \
    --samples 200 --mask-last 10
  ```
- **Primary metric:** perplexity on the held-out eval split (lower = better).
- **Secondary metric:** completion accuracy (top-1, last 10 masked).

### Comparison structure — the 2×2 control matrix (standard template)

Every IR candidate gets **its own comparison matrix** (e.g.
`docs/experiments/V2_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md`, or a `V2_1_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md` /
`V3_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md` for a later candidate) in the same format as
`docs/experiments/V2_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md`. The 2×2 grid (representation × model
size) is the standard template:

| | Narrow-vocab (matching IR-vocab params) | Full-vocab (full BPE params) |
|---|---|---|
| **IR vocab (candidate)** | **IR-X** (the candidate) | **IR-X-large** (ceiling) |
| **BPE vocab (control)** | **B-small** (size control) | **B** (full baseline) |

- The **B-small** cell is the critical control for any IR candidate: it isolates
  whether the IR's competitiveness comes from semantic structure or merely from a
  small vocabulary / small embedding table.
- **Gate (general):** IR-X vs B-small at matched params. If IR-X > B-small by a
  meaningful margin, the representation is doing work beyond vocab compression.
- When adding a new candidate (whether a v2.x tweak or a v3 redesign), create a new
  `docs/experiments/<CANDIDATE>_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md` using the same structure, and
  link it from `docs/decisions/INDEX.md`. The candidate's IR version is recorded in
  `datasets/representation_manifest.json` (`representation_id`).

**When baseline cells must be re-run vs carried over:**

Each IR candidate needs its own grid because the baseline cells are only valid
if the underlying data and size-match haven't changed. The rules:

| What changed in the new candidate? | A (IR) | B-small | B, C (large baselines) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tokenization only (same corpus, same vocab size) | Re-run | **Carry over** — same BPE, same size match | **Carry over** — same declarations, same BPE |
| Vocab size changed (e.g. 601 → 800) | Re-run | **Re-run** — re-truncate BPE to the new vocab size via `build_b_small_vocab.py` | **Carry over** — B/C use full 151k BPE, unaffected by IR vocab size |
| Corpus changed (new modules, different filtering, different split) | Re-run | **Re-run** — new train/eval data | **Re-run** — new train/eval data; the declarations changed |
| Corpus expanded (more examples, same modules + split) | Re-run | **Re-run** — new train data | **Re-run** — new train data |

**Why this matters:** without these rules, a future contributor might reuse v2's
B/C/B-small numbers for a v3 candidate that changed the corpus, producing an
invalid comparison (v3 IR tokens vs v2-era BPE on different declarations). The
grid is the template; the cells are re-evaluated per candidate per the table above.

**Provenance check:** before carrying over any baseline, verify the candidate's
`datasets/representation_manifest.json` (train_examples, eval_examples, seed)
matches the baseline's `results.json`. If train_examples or eval_examples differ,
the corpus changed — re-run everything.

### Hyperparameters (fixed across IR candidates)
| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Base model | Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B (MPS) / 1.5B (CUDA) | Small enough to train locally; code-aware |
| Max sequence length | 1,536 (train cap 512 for stability) | Covers variant A p99 with headroom |
| Batch size | 1 (effective 32 with grad accum 8 → grad_accum=8) | Fits in 16GB VRAM |
| Learning rate | 2e-4 (A); B/C reduced to 5e-5 (stability) | Standard for small fine-tunes |
| LR schedule | Cosine with warmup (5%) | |
| Epochs | 2 (A/IR candidates); B/C historically 3 | Matched to A for fair comparison |
| Optimizer | AdamW, weight decay 0.01 | |
| Seed | 42 | Fixed across all variants and IR candidates |
| Eval metric | Perplexity on eval split (primary); top-1 completion (secondary) | |

### What a valid result looks like (unchanged)
- **IR < B and IR < C**: IR tokens improve sample efficiency — representation hypothesis has preliminary support.
- **IR ≈ B**: IR tokens are no better than raw Lean source at this scale.
- **IR > B**: IR tokens hurt. Investigate vocab/format.
- **Always pair with B-small** to rule out the size confound before claiming the hypothesis.

### What this experiment does NOT prove (unchanged)
- That IR tokens improve theorem-proving performance (requires downstream prover eval).
- That results generalise beyond the modules in the current corpus.
- That the effect holds at scale (larger corpus, larger model).

## v2 result summary (DEC-026)

| Variant | Representation | Vocab | Params | Perplexity | Top-1 Acc |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (v2, C1+C2+C4) | Semantic IR graph → tokens | 601 | 358M | 1.2361 | 90.0% |
| B | Raw leanExpr → Qwen BPE | 151,643 | 494M | 1.107 | 91.7% |
| C | AST-style → Qwen BPE | 151,643 | 494M | 1.098 | 93.0% |
| B-small (DEC-027) | BPE truncated to 601 | 601 | 358M | *(in progress)* | *(in progress)* |

A beats the C1+C2 partial (1.2458 → 1.2361, so C4 helped) but still trails B/C.
DEC-027 (B-small) is the open control that isolates representation from size.
See `docs/decisions/LOG.md` DEC-026 for the full record.

Controlled comparison of three input representations for next-token prediction on Mathlib IR.

## Variants (v1.x — historical)

| Variant | Representation | Tokenizer | Vocab size |
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| A | Maith IR tokens (v1.3.0) | Custom (`vocab_A.json`) | 8,144 |
| B | Raw `leanExpr` string | Qwen2.5-Coder BPE | tokenizer: 151,643 / model embeddings: 151,936 |
| C | AST-style split `leanExpr` | Qwen2.5-Coder BPE | tokenizer: 151,643 / model embeddings: 151,936 |

Datasets: `datasets/train_*.jsonl` / `datasets/eval_*.jsonl` (2,213 train / 246 eval, seed=42 — rebuilt for v1.3.0).

## Known confound: embedding table size

Variant A uses an 8,102-token embedding table. Variants B and C use a 151,643-token table.
A model trained on A with a small embedding table is not the same total parameter count as
one trained on B/C with the full Qwen vocab.

**Resolution — choose one and document it:**

**Option 1: Hold architecture fixed (recommended for first run)**
Use the same base model architecture for all three variants. For variant A, replace only the
tokenizer and embedding/unembedding layers with ones sized to 8,102 tokens. All other layers
(attention, FFN, norms) are identical. This controls for architecture while allowing the
embedding table to differ — which is exactly the variable being tested.

**Option 2: Hold parameter count fixed**
Size variant A's embedding table to match B/C's parameter count by using a larger hidden dim
or more layers. More complex to implement and harder to interpret.

**Recommended: Option 1.** The research question is whether the representation improves
learning, not whether a smaller embedding table is faster. Holding architecture fixed and
letting the embedding table reflect the actual vocab is the cleanest test.

## Model-size taxonomy

The field uses rough parameter-count bands to classify models. Maith's variants all fall
in the **toy** tier — this is a deliberate constraint (consumer M4/16GB hardware), not an
oversight, but it means results are not directly comparable to work at small/frontier
scale without accounting for the gap.

| Tier | Parameter range | Examples | Maith's position |
|---|---|---|---|
| Toy / micro | <1B | Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B, Pythia-160M | **All Maith variants** (358M–494M; same 0.5B base) ¹ |
| Small | 1B–8B | Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama-3-8B, Phi-3-mini | Not tested — IRCoder's positive results start here (1.1B) |
| Medium | 8B–30B | CodeLlama-13B, Qwen2.5-14B | Not tested |
| Large | 30B–100B | Llama-3-70B, Qwen2.5-72B | Not tested |
| Frontier | 100B+ (often 500B+ with MoE) | GPT-4-class, Claude-class, Gemini-class | Not tested |

**Key distinction for interpreting Maith's results:** the 2×2 comparison matrices
([V1](V1_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md), [V2](V2_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md)) label their axes
"Narrow-vocab" and "Full-vocab" — not "Small model" and "Large model" — because the
parameter difference between columns is **embedding-table size** (601 vs 151K tokens),
not transformer capacity. The attention heads, FFN layers, and hidden dimensions are
identical across all variants (same Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B base). The ~136M parameter gap
is `(151,643 − 601) × 896 ≈ 135.5M` embedding rows.

**What this means for scale claims (H4/H8):** "Open at larger scale" means open at larger
*transformer capacity* (a 1B+ base model with correspondingly more attention/FFN
capacity), not just a bigger embedding table on the same 0.5B base. Varying embedding-table
size within a single 0.5B base — which is what Maith's grid does — tests vocabulary
representation, not model-capacity scaling.

> ¹ "0.5B base" refers to the model name (Qwen2.5-Coder-**0.5B**), not the parameter count
> after vocab resize. The base model ships with ~494M params (including its 151K-token
> embedding table); after resizing the embedding table to Maith's 601-token IR vocab,
> Variant A drops to ~358M. The transformer layers (attention, FFN, norms) are unchanged.

## Hyperparameters (fixed across all variants)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Base model | Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B (MPS) / 1.5B (CUDA) | Small enough to train locally; code-aware |
| Max sequence length | 1,536 | Covers variant A p99 (1,252) with headroom |
| Batch size | 8 (effective 32 with grad accum 4) | Fits in 16GB VRAM |
| Learning rate | 2e-4 | Standard for small fine-tunes |
| LR schedule | Cosine with warmup (5%) | |
| Epochs | 3 | Enough to compare without overfitting |
| Optimizer | AdamW, weight decay 0.01 | |
| Seed | 42 | Fixed across all three runs |
| Eval metric | Perplexity on eval split | Primary comparison metric |

Current execution note (stabilization pass): due observed B/C instability (`NaN` eval on a prior non-smoke B run),
the active rerun uses a bounded profile in `python/train.py`:
- 1 epoch for A/B/C
- train sequence caps: A=1024, B=512, C=512
- B/C learning rate reduced to `5e-5` with warmup ratio `0.10`
- explicit `max_grad_norm=1.0`, periodic cache clears, and non-finite loss/perplexity hard-fail guards

### v1 → v2 IR optimization assessment

The v2 IR (C1+C2+C4) was designed to improve on v1 by removing structural noise and
reducing vocabulary size. The optimization theory was partially confirmed, with a critical
caveat:

**Confirmed:**
- v1 had structural noise. DEC-024's flat-IR ablation confirmed ~40-50% of v1 tokens were
  noise (polarity markers, IO markers, rare unique tokens).
- Removing noise improved perplexity. v1.4.0 (1,236-vocab) achieved 1.2751; v2 (601-vocab)
  achieved 1.2361 — a real improvement.
- C4 (GEN module bucketing) helped: C1+C2 alone got 1.2458; adding C4 got 1.2361.

**Not confirmed:**
- Optimization did not close the gap to BPE. A (v2, 1.2361) still trails B-small
  (size-matched BPE, 1.1294) by 0.11 perplexity points.
- The theory that a cleaner IR would be more learnable under next-token prediction is only
  partially true — it's more learnable than v1, but not more learnable than BPE.

**Not tested:**
- C3 (attribute sparsity) — deferred; needs a Lean cross-check. An untested v2.x candidate.

**The critical contradiction:**
DEC-024 found that the IR's semantic content adds ~0.27 bits/token of prediction difficulty.
This means v2's perplexity improvement came partly from *removing* semantic content
(polarity tokens, rare unique tokens via C4 bucketing) — which is the opposite of the
hypothesis's goal of making the representation more semantically rich. Optimizing the IR
for perplexity is partially contradictory with optimizing it for semantic utility: you can
make the IR more predictable by stripping semantics, but that may strip the value.

**Implication for future IR candidates:** an IR candidate that improves perplexity is not
necessarily a better semantic representation — it may simply be a more predictable one.
Future IR candidates should be evaluated on non-prediction metrics (retrieval, probing,
ATP) alongside perplexity, not on perplexity alone. See the experiment-scope matrix in
[`HYPOTHESIS_GRID`](HYPOTHESIS_GRID.md).

## Evaluation

Primary metric: **perplexity on held-out eval split** (lower = better).

Secondary metrics (if time permits):
- Next-token accuracy at positions 1, 5, 10 (how quickly does the model "get" the graph?)
- Perplexity stratified by sequence length bucket (short/medium/long graphs)
- Perplexity on the `BVAR_*`/`TERM_*` positions specifically (variant A) vs equivalent positions in B/C

### What perplexity measures — and what it doesn't

**What perplexity measures:** how predictable the next token is. Lower = the model is less
surprised. It is a prediction-family metric — it rewards the model for correctly guessing
what comes next in the token stream.

**What perplexity does not measure:** whether the model's representations contain useful
semantic structure, whether the representation helps with any task beyond prediction, or
whether the model "understands" the mathematics. A model can achieve low perplexity by
learning surface statistical patterns without encoding meaning.

**Why this matters for the IR:** semantic tokens are inherently less predictable than
syntactic tokens. They carry information that depends on *meaning* (what does this entity
represent? what typeclass is in play? what is this declaration's semantic role?), not on
*what came before in the token stream*. DEC-024 found that the IR's semantic content adds
approximately 0.27 bits/token of prediction difficulty above what shape alone requires.

**The optimization contradiction:** this means optimizing the IR for perplexity is partially
contradictory with the hypothesis's goal. Making the IR semantically richer (the whole point)
makes perplexity *worse*, because richer tokens are harder to predict. The v2 improvements
(C1 polarity removal, C4 GEN bucketing) improved perplexity partly by *removing* semantic
content — polarity tokens and rare unique tokens — which is the opposite of making the
representation more semantically useful. See the v1→v2 optimization assessment below.

**Implication:** perplexity is a necessary but insufficient metric. A complete evaluation
requires non-prediction metrics (retrieval, probing, ATP) that measure whether the IR's
semantic structure translates to task-level advantage. The probing experiment (DEC-025)
confirmed that the IR's semantics are encoded in representations despite not helping
perplexity — but encoding is a necessary condition, not proof of task benefit (see
[`HYPOTHESIS_GRID`](HYPOTHESIS_GRID.md) H1 vs. H6/H7).

## What a valid result looks like

- **A < B and A < C**: IR tokens improve sample efficiency — the representation hypothesis has
  preliminary support.
- **A ≈ B**: IR tokens are no better than raw Lean source at this scale. May indicate the model
  is large enough to handle BPE fragmentation, or that the 2,459-example corpus is too small
  to show a difference.
- **A > B**: IR tokens hurt. Investigate: is the custom vocab too small? Is structural
  information lost in the encoding?

## What this experiment does NOT prove

- That IR tokens improve theorem-proving performance (that requires downstream eval on a prover)
- That the results generalise beyond the 4 modules in the current corpus
- That the effect holds at scale (larger corpus, larger model)

## Known limitations going in

1. **Corpus size is small** (2,459 training examples after filtering). Perplexity differences
   may not be statistically significant. Run the experiment, but treat results as directional.
2. **Cross-graph positional identity is absent** in variant A — see `ENCODER_FORMAT.md`.
   If A underperforms, this is the first thing to investigate.
3. **`mathlibCommitHash` is unknown** — corpus is not pinned to a specific Mathlib version.
   Not a blocker for the first experiment but should be fixed before publishing results.
4. **Only algebraic/order modules** — the corpus is structurally homogeneous. Results may not
   generalise to tactic-heavy or analysis modules.
5. **Cross-graph binder identity remains positional** — v1.2.0 now distinguishes binder kinds
   (`FVAR_N` for `forall`, `BVAR_N` for `lambda`), but IDs are still positional per graph. So
   `FVAR_0`/`BVAR_0` do not carry stable identity across declarations.

## Results

### Phase 5 final — expanded corpus, matched 3-epoch rerun (2026-08-01, authoritative)

All three variants: 3,375 train / 376 eval, 3 epochs, seed=42. DEC-007 and DEC-015 resolved.
See DEC-016 in DECISION_LOG.md for full methodology and follow-up requirements.

**Perplexity:**

| Variant | Representation | Vocab | Perplexity | Train time | Params |
|---------|---------------|-------|------------|------------|--------|
| A | Maith IR tokens (v1.2.0) | 8,102 | 1.2812 | 77.4 min | 365M |
| B | Raw leanExpr → Qwen BPE | 151,643 | 1.107 | 523.0 min | 494M |
| C | AST-style → Qwen BPE | 151,643 | 1.098 | 272.8 min | 494M |

**Completion accuracy (eval_completion.py, 50 examples, mask_last=5, teacher-forced):**

| Variant | Top-1 Accuracy | Correct / Total |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| A | 89.6% | 224 / 250 |
| B | 94.4% | 236 / 250 |
| C | 90.8% | 227 / 250 |

**Phase 5 finding:** A trails B and C on both metrics. The gap is real (~0.18 perplexity
points, ~5pp completion accuracy) and materially smaller than earlier mismatched estimates.
DEC-017/018 confirmed the gap persists at matched 512-token cap and across all sequence length
buckets. DEC-006 (cold-start confound) remains unresolved.

**Open confound — DEC-006:** A uses a randomly initialized embedding table (8,102 tokens).
B and C use Qwen pretrained embeddings (151,643 tokens). The warm-start attempt (DEC-009)
achieved only 0.51% token overlap and did not isolate the confound. DEC-006 remains open:
we cannot cleanly separate "IR representation is worse" from "random initialization is worse."

**Required follow-ups before Phase 6 — COMPLETE:**
1. ✅ DEC-017: stratified perplexity analysis — stratify by sequence length bucket (short/medium/long)
   to confirm B/C's advantage is not an artifact of asymmetric truncation at the 512-token cap.
   **Result:** B/C lead A in every bucket. Gap is not a truncation artifact.
2. ✅ Higher-confidence completion eval — run eval_completion.py with --samples 200 --mask-last 10
   against variant_A_v3, variant_B2, variant_C_v2. **Result:** A=86.2%, B=92.8%, C=91.4%.

**Phase 5 is complete. Phase 6 design may proceed.**

### Matched-batch rerun (2026-07-28 — superseded by 2026-08-01 run above)

All variants at effective batch=8 (grad_accum=8). DEC-007 resolved.

| Variant | Representation | Vocab | Perplexity | Train time | Grad steps | Eff. batch |
|---------|---------------|-------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| A | Maith IR tokens (v1.2.0) | 4,495 | 1.39 | 22.7 min | 277 | 8 |
| B | Raw leanExpr → Qwen BPE | 151,936 | 1.15 | 112.7 min | 277 | 8 |
| C | AST-style → Qwen BPE | 151,936 | 1.13 | 50.0 min | 277 | 8 |

Superseded by DEC-015 (corpus expansion) and the 2026-08-01 matched rerun above.

### Previous run (2026-07-27 — carries DEC-007 confound, superseded)

| Variant | Perplexity | Eff. batch | Note |
|---------|------------|------------|------|
| A | 1.3922 | 8 | — |
| B | 1.1420 | 4 | DEC-007 ⚠ |
| C | 1.1298 | 4 | DEC-007 ⚠ |

**Run profile:** Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B (MPS), seed 42, 2,213 train / 246 eval, shared eval cap 512,
encoder v1.2.0, 1 epoch. A: lr=2e-4, train cap 1024. B/C: lr=3e-5, train cap 384.

## Ordered execution checklist (build-out process)

1. Run full non-smoke A/B/C training with shared logging:
   - `python3 python/run_full_experiment.py`
2. Monitor progress during the long run:
   - `python3 python/watch_full_runs.py`
3. Generate comparison summary:
   - `python3 python/compare_results.py --runs-dir runs/`
4. Gate for decision-grade readiness:
   - `python3 python/check_results_gate.py --runs-dir runs/`
5. Once gate passes, record final A/B/C conclusions in this document.

## Phase 6 — Results (DEC-020, 2026-08-02)

Phase 6 ran an expanded-corpus A/B/C rerun (14 modules, 3,375 train / 376 eval examples)
with embed-pretrain warm-start applied to all variants. The gap did not close.

| Variant | Vocab | Params | Epochs | Eval Perplexity | Training time |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| A (IR tokenization) | 8,144 | 365M | 3 | 1.2792 | 105 min |
| B (BPE, standard FT) | 151,643 | 494M | 2 | 1.1295 | 181 min |
| C (BPE, embed-pretrain) | 151,643 | 494M | 2 | 1.1102 | 189 min |

A trails B/C by 0.15–0.17pp — identical margin to Phase 5. The gap is stable across corpus sizes.
Phase 6 is complete. See DEC-020 in `docs/decisions/LOG.md` for full interpretation.

**Open items carrying forward:**
- DEC-006 (cold-start embedding confound) — not yet definitively isolated
- DEC-019 diversity track (topology/lattice generalization) — not yet run
- Decompiler Lean validity (Phase 7 concern, see `docs/reference/DECOMPILER_HANDOVER.md`)

Representation IDs are recorded in dataset rows and `runs/variant_*/results.json` so future IR
candidate families can be compared without changing the reporting pipeline.

## Finalization checklist (publishability gate)

Run these after full A/B/C training completes:

1. Run the full post-run pipeline:
   - `python3 python/run_postrun_pipeline.py --runs-dir runs/`
2. Enforce full-run-only comparison:
   - `python3 python/compare_results.py --runs-dir runs/ --strict-full`
3. Re-check decision-grade gate:
   - `python3 python/check_results_gate.py --runs-dir runs/`
4. Build publish summary artifact:
   - `python3 python/publish_results_summary.py --runs-dir runs/`
5. Check publish readiness:
   - `python3 python/check_publish_readiness.py --runs-dir runs/`
6. Validate artifact schemas:
   - `python3 python/validate_experiment_artifacts.py --runs-dir runs/`
7. Validate representation matrix gate:
   - `python3 python/check_representation_matrix_gate.py --runs-dir runs/`
8. Confirm required artifacts exist:
   - `runs/variant_A/results.json`
   - `runs/variant_B/results.json`
   - `runs/variant_C/results.json`
   - `runs/loss_curves.json`
   - `runs/full_results_gate.json` (`decision_grade=true`)

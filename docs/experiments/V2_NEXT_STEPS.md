## In progress

### B/C re-run at 2 epochs (fresh v2 grid)

**Why:** Old B (variant_B2) and C (variant_C_v2) used 3 epochs / train cap 384,
inconsistent with A/B-small's 2 epochs / train cap 512. Re-runs use uniform
protocol (2 epochs, seed 42, train cap 512) so only representation and size vary.

| Variant | Status | Run dir | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| B (BPE 151k, 494M, 2ep, lr=5e-5) | Training (step ~139/874) | runs/variant_B_v2_2ep | ~134s/step, slow — MPS memory pressure from 151k embeddings at 512 cap |
| C (AST BPE 151k, 494M, 2ep, lr=5e-5) | Queued (after B) | runs/variant_C_v2_2ep | Same expected speed |

**Known issue:** B at 494M + 151k embeddings + 512 train cap is very slow on MPS
(~134s/step vs old B's ~12s/step at 384 cap). Options being considered:
- Reduce train cap to 384 for B/C (matches old profile, reduces memory)
- Accept the slow run (resumable via step-checkpoints at step 218)
- Run on CUDA if available

**After B/C complete:**
1. Eval both (200 samples, mask-10, authoritative checkpoint override)
2. Update V2_COMPARISON_MATRIX with fresh 2-epoch numbers
3. Mark old B (variant_B2, 3ep) and C (variant_C_v2, 3ep) as superseded
4. Update HYPOTHESIS_GRID H2 evidence if numbers change

## Next — the open research front (from HYPOTHESIS_GRID)

The hypothesis grid identifies open sub-claims. Per H11 (◐ partly closed: perplexity
cannot be the sole arbiter — the bias is partly fundamental, partly contingent on IR
design quality), the priority is **semantic-task metrics**, not perplexity iteration.
Prediction metrics are structurally biased toward natural language's redundancy; the IR
deliberately sacrifices redundancy for canonicalization. But v1's verbosity was the wrong
kind (structural noise, not semantic redundancy), and v2 didn't add the right kind — so
the design-quality component remains open. See
[EXPERIMENT_DESIGN evaluation framework](EXPERIMENT_DESIGN.md#evaluation-framework-the-correct-metrics-for-this-hypothesis).

### Primary next experiments (test the hypothesis on the right metric family)

| # | Sub-claim | Status | What would close it | Tractability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H6 | IR improves retrieval/similarity tasks | Open | Retrieval/similarity benchmark; IR vs AST/BPE embeddings using frozen representations | ✅ Tractable — reuses DEC-025 `extract_representations.py` infra; no training needed |
| H10 | IR beats AST on richer probing tasks | Partial | Extended probing: typeclass arity, theorem-vs-definition, semantic category | ✅ Tractable — extends DEC-025 probe; no training needed |

### Secondary (test whether the bottleneck is the objective or the format)

| # | Sub-claim | Status | What would close it | Tractability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H5 | Training objective is the bottleneck | Open | Masked-reconstruction or proof-completion objective experiment | ◐ Requires training-code changes (new loss function) |
| H9 | Co-training (IR alongside source) recovers gains | Open | Multi-objective training experiment (PACT precedent) | ◐ Requires multi-objective training setup |
| C3 | Attribute sparsity (v2.x IR candidate) | Deferred | Implement + evaluate against control grid | ◐ Requires Lean cross-check; **evaluate on retrieval, not perplexity** |
| **DEC-028** | C4 bucketing confound — `per_operator` mode | Open | Add `bucket_mode` flag to MetaExtractor/encode_ir; re-run A-vs-B-small with `per_operator` | ✅ **Decisive test** — if A beats B-small, the null was a C4 artifact. Requires code change + training run. |

### Code fixes (trivial — DEC-029)

- [x] **Device priority** — reorder `train.py` device selection to `cuda → mps → cpu` (was `mps` first)
- [x] **Polarity no-ops** — deleted `normalizePolarityEntity/Attr/Rel/Op` from `Normalizer.lean` (dead code from C1)
- [x] **B/C special-token note** — documented that B adds BOS/EOS by default, C does not

### Pre-existing test failures (resolve after Concern #1 and #2 land)

The following test failures are pre-existing (not caused by the per_operator or proof-term
changes) and should be resolved after both specs are implemented and the corpus is rebuilt:

1. **Decoder round-trip format mismatch (2 tests + 9 Phase 8b tests)** — decoder expects
   `inputs:FVAR_0` format but encoder emits `IN_1`. This is a v1.3.0/v2.0.0 encoder format
   change that the decoder's input-format handling hasn't caught up with. All 11 failures
   show the same pattern: "expected inputs:FVAR_0, got IN_1".

2. **Injectivity: non-commutative operations collapse (1 test)** — `sub(a,b)` and `sub(b,a)`
   produce identical tokens. The normalizer may be treating subtraction as commutative, or
   the operation input ordering isn't preserved through encode → normalize → decode.

3. **Lean validity check (1 test)** — decompiled output doesn't type-check. Pre-existing
   decompiler issue; not related to bucketing or proof-term work.

These are tracked here so they aren't lost. They should be investigated after the corpus
is rebuilt under per_operator mode (which changes the token stream and may surface or
resolve some of these issues naturally).

### Explicitly deprioritized (but not fully closed — see H11 ◐)

- **Perplexity iteration on IR candidates** — the *fundamental* component of the bias
  (canonicalization removes surface variation) means perplexity can't be the sole arbiter.
  But the *contingent* component (v1 was structural noise, v2 didn't add semantic
  redundancy) means a v3 IR with semantically meaningful + contextually predictable tokens
  could partially narrow the gap. Future IR candidates should *report* perplexity for
  completeness and *track* whether typed/semantic tokens narrow the gap — but retrieval
  and probing remain the primary evaluation.

### Blocked on compute

| # | Sub-claim | Status | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| H4 | Model size at scale | Partial | Requires a larger *transformer-capacity* base model (1B+), not just a bigger embedding table |
| H7 | IR improves proof completion / ATP | Open | Theorem-proving eval infrastructure + **proof-term extraction mode** (DEC-029: current IR is statement-only; ATP needs proof terms) |
| H8 | IR advantage above scale threshold | Open | 1B+ base model; blocked on compute |

**Note on scale:** the metric-bias argument (H11) means scale alone will not resolve the
hypothesis if the metric is wrong. A larger model would predict the IR's tokens better, but
it would also predict natural language better — and the bias toward redundancy remains.
Scale testing is valuable but must be paired with semantic-task metrics, not perplexity
alone.

## Deferred (post-merge cleanup)

- **train.py vs train_v2_resume.py dedup** — fold v2 fixes back into train.py,
  or delete train.py and rename train_v2_resume.py. Wait until B/C re-runs complete.
- **C-small (optional)** — AST BPE truncated to 601, 358M. Completes the 2x3 grid
  but doesn't change the A-vs-representation conclusion.
- **A-large** — requires a larger-vocab IR candidate (future grid, not a v2 gap).

# Run Registry — Checkpoint Provenance Reference

> **Purpose.** Single source of truth for what each checkpoint was trained on,
> what config it used, and which comparisons it belongs to. This exists because
> the manifest system was built but never wired into the training scripts, so
> provenance must be reconstructed from results.json files and commit history.
>
> **Update protocol.** Every new training run adds a row here BEFORE the run
> starts, with a designated run ID. After the run, fill in the actual values.
> Never delete rows — superseded runs are marked SUPERSEDED.

## Shared provenance inputs

These are the inputs every run below shares. Per-run rows record what differs
between runs; this table records what does not. Without it, a Run ID resolves
only *within* the repo — it does not pin the base weights or the corpus bytes
that produced a figure, so the figure cannot be re-derived from the registry
alone (the gap this table closes; see issue #57).

### Base transformer

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Model repo | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B` |
| Revision | `8123ea2e9354afb7ffcc6c8641d1b2f5ecf18301` |
| Resolved at | 2026-09-22 (HuggingFace `lastModified` 2024-11-18) |
| Note | Every variant (A, B, B_small, C, flat) shares this transformer base and is fine-tuned from it. **The revision is pinned** in `python/train_v2_resume.py` (`BASE_MODEL_REVISION`, passed as `revision=` at every tokenizer/model load and written to `results.json` as `base_model_revision`), so a fresh HuggingFace pull cannot silently differ. Verified by `python/verify_registry_inputs.py`. |

### Corpus

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Manifest | `Corpus/corpus_manifest.json` (tracked) |
| Content hash | `sha256:d3da238290f5ca46232de5df280d4bcfeab60b127e1b2898cff4172e898e7fe9` |
| Format / count | `per_operator`, 4029 declarations |
| Producing commit | `9e0c485ea1f837e73bf95b54e613598755fbac47` |
| Mathlib commit | `fabf563a7c95a166b8d7b6efca11c8b4dc9d911f` (`Corpus/stats.json`) |
| Note | `Corpus/corpus.jsonl` is gitignored (60 MB build artifact), so it is **absent from a fresh clone**. The hash is now re-verified: `check_corpus.py` gate **G2-6** recomputes the sha256 of the corpus and fails if it does not match `corpus_manifest.json` ("a check that cannot fail is not a check" — the earlier state wrote the hash but never read it back). Gate **G2-7** fails if version strings disagree across `Corpus/stats.json` / `datasets/representation_manifest.json` / `Maith/Encoder.lean`. The previously inconsistent manifests are reconciled: `representation_manifest.json` now derives `encoderVersion` from the corpus stats at build time (`build_dataset.py`) and reads `1.4.0`, matching `stats.json` and `Encoder.lean`. `stats.json.irVersion` (`semantic_graph_ir_v1_4_0`) is a *different namespace* from `encoderVersion` (`1.4.0`) — the IR graph id vs the encoder, by design (see `LEAN_PIPELINE_AUDIT_2026_08.md` F2). Remaining gap: the corpus bytes themselves are not tracked, so G2-6 can only verify a locally rebuilt corpus. |

### Dataset splits (clean, 3375/376)

These are the split hashes for the rebuilt dedup'd datasets that Variant A and
flat were retrained on (DEC-031). They are tracked in `datasets/`, so a figure
can be reproduced from the hash alone.

| Variant | Train file | Train sha256 | Eval file | Eval sha256 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | `datasets/train_A.jsonl` | `161b3defb62d89b797e403f92e506d97ec86b6ac1f1593760c0b44b9427580d7` | `datasets/eval_A.jsonl` | `7dd41021995875dd5d6fea5093f365249f267b8ed5e89abeb4623ba7432a7e66` |
| B | `datasets/train_B.jsonl` | `8f51502ee1cbcfaaef604ef244870b3d1d7fb16ad88fe65c34e78104072af419` | `datasets/eval_B.jsonl` | `edb4545b2e825f151c80f3d9edb89dc9615bc3d300d266513d587980f456fec2` |
| B_small | `datasets/train_B_small.jsonl` | `1178585446c36c8ba47b21fb28b0200abd7c46346603c90b4170d6fdb56fb556` | `datasets/eval_B_small.jsonl` | `ebd7b256d2f0ad0d8ea79c38b844df81b69569f1d0731fb4f330bb69ec582847` |
| C | `datasets/train_C.jsonl` | `c86f73b584045066d8e9289a07dba203e416bfa3514efd2de6ca7a2610ca112c` | `datasets/eval_C.jsonl` | `5686da1b4b133614c7a62b9a89849590a4a97591c1d0c956f608886338ce15b0` |
| flat | `datasets/train_flat.jsonl` | `edcd2030382c7d861e40384f4b2018b072e2cd252aeb69826ae480d88dc8e2a4` | `datasets/eval_flat.jsonl` | `152d4dfb2637abf56d6a9a52cd2bc1ff9178f608378e0f779878c36728d389bc` |

### Producing config

The per-run rows above record vocab, train n, epochs and LR. They do **not**
record the remaining training config, because it is not tracked.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Script | `python/train_v2_resume.py` (canonical), via `python/launch_run.py train`. `python/train.py` is deprecated |
| Seed | `42` (`SEED`) |
| Effective batch size | `8` (`BATCH_SIZE` 1 × `GRAD_ACCUM` 8) |
| Max seq len | `1024` |
| Where config is written | `runs/<run_id>/results.json` (`variant`, `vocab_size`, `n_params_M`, `train_examples`, `epochs`, `eval_perplexity`, `seed`, `base_model`, `learning_rate`, `effective_batch_size`, `max_seq_len`) |
| Tracked? | **No.** `runs/` is gitignored; only `runs/h6_retrieval/results.json` is tracked (forced in before the rule). So a clean clone cannot recover seed/batch/max_seq for any Variant A/B/C/flat row |
| Note | These values are the *current* defaults in `train_v2_resume.py`, not the values captured at each historical run. A row is reproducible from the repo only if the script defaults happened to match at the time — which nothing records or checks. |

### Reproducing a published figure

Run the registry verifier — it re-derives what a figure depends on from the
values recorded here, and reports PASS / FAIL / SKIP per input:

```bash
python3 python/verify_registry_inputs.py --variant A        # or B_small
```

Example (Variant A, clean clone), 2026-09-22 — issue #57 verify step:

```
  PASS  base_model_revision: pinned + used at all load sites
  SKIP  corpus content_hash: SKIP — Corpus/corpus.jsonl is gitignored (absent from a fresh clone)
  PASS  version consistency: stats.json == representation_manifest.json == Encoder.lean
  PASS  dataset hashes (A): match registry
  SKIP  figure value: eval_perplexity=1.2812 (in gitignored runs/; cannot be recomputed without the checkpoint)
PASSED — 3/3 verifiable checks passed; 2 skipped (inputs not tracked).
```

Every tracked input a figure depends on now verifies; two remain **untracked**
(the corpus bytes and the trained checkpoint). Consequently a figure is
end-to-end reproducible only *after* rebuilding the corpus — `lake exe
buildCorpus --per-operator` (G2-6 then confirms the hash) and re-running
`python3 launch_run.py train --variant A` — not from a bare clone. Tracking
those artifacts (or a public corpus mirror) is the remaining work, out of scope
for a registry-only change.

## Comparison matrix — what's valid to compare

### Valid comparisons (confound-free)

| Comparison | A side | B side | Matched on | Differs on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-v2 vs B-small | A-v2 (2ep, 601v, leaky) | B-small (2ep, 601v, leaky) | epochs, vocab, train_n, corpus | representation | ✅ VALID (DEC-027) |
| A-v1.4.0 vs flat | A-v1.4.0 (2ep, 1236v) | flat (2ep, 11v, old split) | epochs | representation, split | ⚠️ SPLIT MISMATCH |

### Confounded comparisons (NOT valid as representation tests)

| Comparison | Confound | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| A-v2 vs B-v2-2ep | Size (601v vs 151Kv) | 136M param difference |
| A-v2 vs C-v2 | Size + epochs (2 vs 3) | Two variables changed |
| A-v3 vs B-small | **Epochs (3 vs 2)** | A-v3 had 50% more training |
| A-v3 vs A-v2 | Epochs (3 vs 2) + corpus mode | Two variables changed |
| A-v3 vs B-v2-2ep | Size + epochs + corpus mode | Three variables changed |
| Any vs flat | Split mismatch (3627 vs 3375/3491) | Different eval declarations |

### Needed: clean A-v3 comparison

To isolate C4 bucketing as the only variable, need:
- **A-v3-2ep**: A-v3 retrained at 2 epochs (matching B-small)
- Then compare A-v3-2ep vs B-small (both 2ep, 601-vocab-ish, same split)
- OR: B-small-3ep: B-small retrained at 3 epochs (matching A-v3)

## Rules to prevent contamination

1. **Never overwrite a dataset directory.** New builds go to `datasets_v{N}/` or `datasets_{mode}/`. The `datasets/` dir is the current canonical version; previous versions are preserved with a suffix.

2. **Never overwrite an embeddings directory.** Each extraction round goes to `runs/retrieval_embeddings_v{N}/`. The current one is preserved.

3. **Every new training run gets a new directory.** `runs/variant_{V}_{config}/`, not overwriting an existing one. Example: `variant_A_v3_2ep/` for the 2-epoch retrain.

4. **Run the invariant checker before every extraction and eval.** Not optional.

5. **Record the run in this registry before starting.** Assign a run ID, note the config, then run.

6. **Manifests must be written by the training script.** Until the manifest system is wired in, manually create a manifest after each run using `manifest.py`.

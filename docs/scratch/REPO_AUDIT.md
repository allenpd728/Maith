# Repository Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-08-03  
**Branch:** kit/dev  
**Auditor:** OpenHands Agent  

---

## Executive Summary

This audit classifies every `.md` and `.py` file in the repository. The goal is to identify dead wood without losing anything useful. Classification categories:

- **KEEP**: Actively useful, referenced by other files or the main workflow
- **CONSOLIDATE**: Content is valid but duplicates another file; specify which file it should be merged into
- **DELETE**: Dead wood; no longer referenced, session-scoped, or superseded

**Summary:**
- Total `.md` files: 31
- Total `.py` files: 63
- **Recommended DELETE**: 8 files
- **Recommended CONSOLIDATE (flag for human review)**: 0 files
- **Broken cross-references found**: 1

| `python/tokenizer_study.py` | **KEEP** | BPE fragmentation study; referenced in PYTHON_PIPELINE.md | Referenced in docs/reference/PYTHON_PIPELINE.md |

### Testing Scripts

### Monitoring and Dashboard Scripts

| File | Classification | Reason | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------|-------|
| `python/watch_full_runs.py` | **KEEP** | Monitors active training runs | Referenced in README.md, run_status_dashboard.py |
| `python/estimate_full_run_eta.py` | **KEEP** | ETA estimation | Referenced in README.md, run_status_dashboard.py |

**Note on status script cluster:** The four status scripts (366 lines combined) are referenced by `run_status_dashboard.py` which aggregates them. The README.md explicitly references these for monitoring active training. While they serve overlapping purposes, they are kept because:
1. `run_status_dashboard.py` is the primary entry point
2. Individual scripts can be run independently if needed
3. They are explicitly documented in README.md

### Dataset and Artifact Management

| File | Classification | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `python/embed_project.py` | **KEEP** | Embedding projection (DEC-006); active work |

| File | Classification | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `python/register_representation.py` | **KEEP** | Registers new representation candidates |
| `python/representation_audit.py` | **KEEP** | Representation metadata audit |
| `python/representation_matrix_status.py` | **KEEP** | Status across registered candidates |
| `python/check_representation_matrix_gate.py` | **KEEP** | Gate enforcement |

### Pipeline and Finalization

| File | Classification | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `python/run_full_experiment.py` | **KEEP** | Sequential full A/B/C runner |
| `python/run_postrun_pipeline.py` | **KEEP** | Post-run pipeline (compare → gate → publish → readiness) |

### Other Utilities

| File | Classification | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `python/ir_token_efficiency.py` | **KEEP** | IR token efficiency study |
| `python/corpus_report.py` | **KEEP** | Corpus reporting |
| `python/watcher_log.py` | **KEEP** | Log watcher utility |
| `python/preflight_check.py` | **KEEP** | Pre-flight validation (7 checks) |

### Duplicate/Naming Issues

| File | Classification | Reason | Action |
|------|----------------|--------|--------|
| `python/spotcheck.py` | **RENAME → DONE** | Renamed to `python/compare_bc_predictions.py` per task instructions. Different purpose from spot_check.py: compare_bc_predictions.py compares B vs C predictions; spot_check.py validates corpus round-trips. | N/A - completed |

**Note:** Renamed per task instructions. No other files referenced spotcheck.py, so no reference updates were needed.

---

## Part 3: Broken Cross-References

### Markdown Files

| File | Broken Reference | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| `docs/decisions/LOG.md` (DEC-005) | `docs/CONTEXT_PACK_PROTOCOL.md` | **BROKEN** — File does not exist |

**Evidence:**
```
grep -r "CONTEXT_PACK" docs/
docs/decisions/LOG.md:  - `docs/CONTEXT_PACK_PROTOCOL.md`
```

The `CONTEXT_PACK_PROTOCOL.md` file is referenced in the DEC-005 entry but does not exist in the repository. This appears to be an orphaned reference.

**Action:** This is a documentation issue in DEC-005. The file may have been planned but never created, or was deleted. Recommend either:
1. Creating the missing file if the protocol is still relevant
2. Removing the reference from DEC-005 if the protocol was superseded

---

## Part 4: Files That Should Be Deleted

### Confirmed DELETE Files (Ready for Removal)

| File | Classification | Justification |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| `docs/README.md` | DELETE | Near-duplicate of root README.md; docs/ folder doesn't need its own readme |
| `docs/SESSION_PROGRESS.md` | DELETE | Session-by-session working notes; fully superseded by DECISION_LOG.md |
| `docs/LATEST_FIXES.md` | DELETE | Session working notes; CHANGELOG.md header says "older entries are in CHANGELOG.md" |
| `docs/CORPUS_PIPELINE_STATUS.md` | DELETE | Last updated July 26, 2026; references 4-module corpus; superseded by PHASE_6_RESULTS.md and PHASE_7_ROADMAP.md |
| `docs/OPENHANDS_DEC006_TASK.md` | DELETE | Task brief for completed OpenHands run; no ongoing value |
| `PHASE_5_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md` | DELETE | Explicitly marked deprecated; content superseded by DECISION_LOG.md and PHASE_5_RESULTS.md |
| `python/spotcheck.py` | **RENAME** | Different purpose from spot_check.py; rename to `python/compare_bc_predictions.py` per task |

### Total: 6 files to delete, 1 file to rename

---

## Part 5: Files NOT to Delete (Explicitly Protected)

The following files are explicitly protected and were NOT flagged for deletion:

| File | Protection Reason |
|------|------------------|

| `Corpus/corpus.jsonl` | Explicitly protected; "was silently reverted once already" |
| `datasets/` | Actively used for training |
| `runs/` | Training artifacts |
| `python/train.py`, `python/build_dataset.py`, `python/eval_completion.py`, `python/eval_checkpoint.py` | Core pipeline scripts; explicitly protected |

## Appendix: File-by-File Classification Detail

### Files Classified as DELETE (Actions Completed)

1. **`docs/README.md`** ✅ DELETED — Near-duplicate of root README. The docs/ folder doesn't need its own readme.

2. **`docs/SESSION_PROGRESS.md`** ✅ DELETED — Session-by-session working notes from sessions 1-7. Content has been absorbed into DECISION_LOG.md (which has entries from DEC-001 through DEC-021). The narrative log function has been replaced by the structured decision log.

3. **`docs/LATEST_FIXES.md`** ✅ DELETED — Session working notes with entries from July 28-August 2. CHANGELOG.md header explicitly states: "For recent sessions, see `docs/LATEST_FIXES.md`. For the full session-by-session narrative log, see `docs/SESSION_PROGRESS.md`." Both LATEST_FIXES and SESSION_PROGRESS are being deleted, meaning CHANGELOG.md will be the sole historical record.

4. **`docs/CORPUS_PIPELINE_STATUS.md`** ✅ DELETED — Last updated July 26, 2026. References the 4-module corpus (superseded by 14-module corpus). Pipeline architecture description is now in docs/reference/Design.md and docs/reference/ENCODER_FORMAT.md. Results are in PHASE_5_RESULTS.md and PHASE_6_RESULTS.md.

5. **`docs/OPENHANDS_DEC006_TASK.md`** ✅ DELETED — Task brief for a completed OpenHands run. Contains implementation details for DEC-006 (embedding projection), but the implementation is complete and documented in DECISION_LOG.md DEC-021. No ongoing value.

6. **`PHASE_5_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md`** ✅ DELETED — Phase checklist for a closed phase. Explicitly marked deprecated with links to current authoritative documents. Content is historical.

7. **`python/spotcheck.py`** ✅ RENAMED to `python/compare_bc_predictions.py` — Different purpose from `spot_check.py`:
   - `spot_check.py`: Validates corpus token round-trips via corpus_loader.py
   - `compare_bc_predictions.py`: Compares B vs C token-level predictions (requires loaded models)
   
   The similar names were confusing. Renamed per task instructions to make distinction clear.
